# Food Waste Reduction App

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a mobile application that tackles food waste and food insecurity in NYC. It connects businesses, restaurants, and individuals with surplus food to users in need, promoting a more sustainable and equitable food system.

## Problem Statement
- Food Waste: Businesses discard substantial amounts of surplus food daily, contributing to environmental and economic burdens.
- Food Insecurity: Many individuals and families, particularly in NYC's homeless population, face food shortages and limited access to healthy meals.

## Target Users
- Business Owners: Restaurants, delis, and grocery stores with surplus food to donate or sell at discounted prices.
- Food Insecure Individuals: People seeking affordable or free food.
- Community Organizations: Groups that coordinate food drives or manage community fridges.
- General Users: Individuals offering extra food from events or looking for discounted food options.

## Vision Statement
Our vision is to create a platform that fosters a strong community network by connecting surplus food sources with those in need. By facilitating food donation, reduced prices, and efficient food access, we strive to:

- Reduce food waste and its associated environmental and economic impacts.
Combat food insecurity by providing access to nutritious food for underserved communities.
